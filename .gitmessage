# Git History Cleanup Completed

## What Was Done
- Removed actual credential values from git history
- Replaced with REDACTED_AT_TOKEN and REDACTED_UBID placeholders
- All commits have been rewritten

## Important Notes
- If you've already pushed to GitHub, you MUST force push:
  ```bash
  git push --force --all
  git push --force --tags
  ```
- Notify any collaborators to re-clone the repository
- The backup branch `backup-before-cleanup` can be deleted after verification

## Verification
Run this to verify credentials are gone:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -E "Atza|gQBxC5RbAwEBAHaMYeSV0COrp|134-9925906-3171060"
```
Should return no results.
